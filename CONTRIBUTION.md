# Contributing Guidelines

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo.
2. clone the forked repo to your local system.
3. do your changes.
4. commit your changes.
5. push to your forked repo.
6. Finally now you can make a pull request!
7. please tag issue number if any issu is resolved.
